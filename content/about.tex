\section{About}
Hi Johan Furelid, my name is Linus. 
Last spring I finished my 5th year on M. Sc in computer engineering at Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall, Sweden (the final diploma has not been obtained yet due to unfinished courses).
Last autumn I started my journey as a software engineer at CGI, but not as a developer.
Instead I work as a consultant tooling specialist.
We maintain the customers developer tools such as Atlassian products, file repository systems, build systems and servers.
We also develop different minor solutions to enable certain tasks and tools. 

But my journey at CGI did not start last autumn. I have been an consultant at CGI for 10 years, if we include the study time.
Under this time I have been doing everything from deploying copper and fiber infrastructure in LKAB's underground mines in Kiruna, responsible technician of LKAB's telephony platform and an Exchange technician as summer jobs.

As a person I'm a positive and structured and has a big passion for clean and structured solutions.
As a coder I like to work with both frontend and backend development, where backend is a little closer to my heart.
Why you might ask? It's simply the reason that I like to work with different data sources, transform them and stitch them together.
I'm also a cross-functional person. Panic in the HTML factory or lack of a scrum master? Sign me up!

I thrive to always leave a task or project with as high standard as possible with good documentation, to make further management easier. 
If the task or project is management I leave it with a higher standard then when I started.

Why would I like to work at Voyd?
You are a fairly young company.
For me this means that I can be a part of a journey, in the growth of the backend technology and the platform in it's whole.
I feel that I can make a contribution to the future of the company.
You are also work with an interesting tech stack with TypeScript and microservices.
This is the areas I want to evolve in since it feels like the modern age of development.
