\section{About}
Hi, my name is Linus! I'm really glad you're reading this.
Who am i? I'm a positive, extremly structured person with a big passion for clean and structured solutions. Born and raised in Kiruna, almost as far north as you can get. I currently studying my 4th year on M. Sc in computer engineering at Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall, Sweden. When it comes to coding I like to work with both frontend and backend development. On my free time (the non computer part of it) i like the nature and walks in the wood with my lovely dog, Kira.
