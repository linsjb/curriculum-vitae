\section{About}
Hi, my name is Linus! I'm really glad you're reading this.
Who am i? I'm a positive, extremly structured person with a big passion for clean and structured solutions. Born and raised in Kiruna, almost as far north as you can get. I recently finished my 5th  year on M. Sc in computer engineering at Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall, Sweden (the final diploma has not been obtained yet due to unfinished courses). 
When it comes to coding I like to work with both frontend and backend development, where backend is a little closer to my heart.
What I like most about development is solving different types of problems that I am asked to solve.
On my free time (the non computer part of it) I like the nature and walks in the wood with my lovely dog, Kira.
